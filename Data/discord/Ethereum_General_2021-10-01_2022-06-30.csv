Blockchains have a scalability trilemma. The three components of this are scaling, security and decentralization. It's a sort of pick two out of three scenario. Ethereum is the only blockchain making meaningful progress towards having all three, but that takes time and research to achieve.

> The threat of a 51% attack still exists in proof-of-stake, but it's even more risky for the attackers. To do so, you'd need to control 51% of the staked ETH. Not only is this a lot of money, but it would probably cause ETH's value to drop. There's very little incentive to destroy the value of a currency you have a majority stake in. There are stronger incentives to keep the network secure and healthy.

More on the current status of the merge https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone/

Some things blocking the merge are client diversity, and testing (which was the purpose of the testnet).

As Micah said, there is no formal ""Eth2"". This is more a legacy name at this point, and really what is happening is there is an execution layer for the transactions, and a consensus layer for consensus. The merge will change this consensus from Proof of Work (current) to Proof of Stake.

A failed transaction _only_ results in the ETH used to pay gas fees to be decremented from the signing account, and that account's nonce being incremented. Transferred tokens or ETH are reverted.

And that depending on the choices made by the community as to what that ‚Äútrilemma‚Äù trade-off looks like, we can either unlock 100% of it or some fraction of that?

Centralized public cloud for example is arguably 100% unlock of compute / storage power given 3 companies basically operate most of the compute power that is ‚Äúrentable‚Äù in the world today

You could almost imagine a 3D graph where if you took each of those trilemma considerations, you could plot each on an axis and have some ‚Äúefficient frontier‚Äù for what a best-in-class cloud computing protocol might look like.

Amazon Web Services is arguably very high on scalability, medium on security, and very low on decentralization 

And I guess the bet within crypto is that there should be more of an importance placed on security and decentralization than purely scalability (running Netflix on AWS is still way easier than on ethereum or Solana to pick an easy web app we all know of & likely use haha)","",""

One of the main reasons why we have decided to remove ETH 2.0 from the terms is because many people can fall into scams and breaches.
Like: Oh, ETH 2.0 is a new coin? Will have another ICO? I will buy the new Ethereum Token etc ...

I have a question about adjusting the difficulty of PoW in ETH.

BTC's PoW is made by adjusting the nance and lining up a certain number of zeros in the hash value, and you can see the actual hash value in the mem pool.
For example, in block 713393, there are 19 zeros in a row.

This was visually very clear and easy to understand.

-(ex)------
Block: 713393
Nance: 0x47c5ea23
Hash: 00000000000000000001fe7b72455215aba74dcaa9ccb5fa0f5767391439c715
------------


However, in ETH, the hash value looks like a random hexadecimal number. If you convert this hash value to decimal, you will get ""32323928331322849603000900144555935130094400391919147514438515011147919782892746348"" and you will not see any regularity.
-(ex)-------
Block: 13772140
Nance: 0x04c6627d43dd943e
Hash: 0x477f62bdbe14a16e65cbe61084887590eaa77334cc9191a09f9ae8fd55bf366c

https://etherscan.io/block/13772140
-------


What are the PoW difficulty settings and hash value targets for ETH...?
I checked the Ethereum.org page about PoW and other pages, but no details were given .........

Getting an error when I try to claim/buy presale tokens (CWEB) from VLaunch I have been awarded. 
The payment is with USDT.
I have 0 USDT in my wallet on Ethereum network and never had any.
I tried to claim without the required USDT funds, hoping I'd get prompted to approve spending of my USDT, which did happen.
Then I was expecting to get some form of error message that I do not have enough funds.
Instead I got the following error message:
execution reverted: SafeERC20: low-level call failed
This is a Metamask error.
Now whenever I try to repeat the operation that's the error message I get - nothing else.
To fix this error do I simply need to transfer the required amount of USDT to my Eth wallet?
Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.","",""

"320943393381548033","Mr.Big Black Cockroach#7292","07-Jan-22 02:27 PM","The difference between ETH and WETH (wrapped ETH) is a common topic of confusion between liquidity providers and traders when interacting with DeFi protocols.

Ether (ETH) is the native token or currency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas, or transaction fees, when interacting or executing contracts on Ethereum.

In the early days, many projects started launching their own tokens with their own functions. In order to create an ecosystem of tokens where they can interact with each other, the ERC-20 token standard was established in 2015 to set rules and regulations as the blueprint for tokens on Ethereum.

For example, the ERC-20 standard defined certain mandatory rules for every token contract such as totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve and allowance.

The ERC-20 standard not only allowed for interoperability between tokens, but also a set of standards that would be useful for exchange listings and transferring tokens from one user to another.

Without the ERC-20 standard established, developers would not be able to easily integrate other tokens into their projects without knowing how to call the functions in the token contract.

Examples of ERC-20 tokens are all over the place, such as Sushiswap‚Äôs SUSHI token, mStable‚Äôs MTA token or Balancer‚Äôs BAL token.

ETH was developed before the ERC-20 standard was established

However, the ERC-20 standard was developed after the native token ETH was released, and ETH in its original form does not conform to its own ERC-20 standard.

In order to facilitate smart contract exchanges for other ERC-20 tokens on decentralised exchanges, ETH has to be first converted, or wrapped into an ERC-20 compliant version ‚Äî WETH ‚Äî which is a standardized format like other ERC-20 tokens.

For example, Aave originally launched on the Ethereum network but now is also on networks like Polygon and Avalanche. To facilitate activity on Aave, two ERC20 tokens are utilized in Aave's smart contract, aToken and AAVE. One example of how native token is used is borrowers who use AAVE as collateral get a discount on fees.

Some questions on launching on multiple networks/chains are:

1. When we want to launch a protocol on Polygon that already exists on say Ethereum, do we just re-deploy the same contract on Polygon?

2. If the protocol utilizes native token in the smart contracts, do we re-deploy the ERC20 token as well? Or require users to bridge their native token from Ethereum to the new Polygon network as a wrapped token? - if so, is doubling the token supply a concern for protocols that had a fixed supply when it was just on a single network?

3. In general, what are the best practices when a protocol is to be launched on multiple networks/chains?

Just FYI we're currently in the process of moving away from the Ethereum 2.0 branding. It is no longer an accurate representation of what is happening. 

Instead, you can think of what was formerly known as Eth2 as three separate upgrades:

Anchor is on Terra's blockchain, it allows you to stake Terra's native stablecoin, UST, for around 19-20% APY return. You can also combine it with their ""sister-protocol"" Mirror, that allows you to use that staked UST and short/long synthetic assets like gold, tesla stocks, apple stock, etc... while still earning that 19-20% yearly interest.

Curve is multichain protocol (it's on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Harmony, Fantom... I'm sure I missed some chain in here), and it's basically a stablecoin swap, it has the deepest liquidity for stablecoins out of all protocols I think.","",""

So, as I understand it, no, you won't be able to mine Ether after the big switch-over.  You can either stake some of your money yourself, in Ether, and receive a steady flow of 'income', in theory (I've heard estimates of 5+,-%).

As for the ZK-SNARK part, the way other blockchains use this is more comparable to ZK rollups like zkSync and Starknet, where transactions are rolled up and only the proof (aka SNARK) is written on the layer 1. What Vitalik is suggesting here is using ZK-SNARKs for other things as well, such as the EVM, signatures, etc., so that the users don‚Äôt need to verify anything and only the block proposer actually needs to run the EVM.","","ü§© (1),üëç (2)"

My thinking is to have that role stored somewhere decentralised so that it could be used by any platform (dapp) to provide a single structure across all dao platforms.
1.  DAO gets application,  2.  Voted approved by threshold of members, 3.  Proposal system owns/access to the ""Role's"" contract and calls a function to add the approved address to a list of council members. Works the same for removals.
Also the (DAO membership)NFT owners can call the contract(or another) to assign other roles to themselves, like Artists Workgroup. If there also could be a Leader role for each self-assigned role (Artist Workgroup Leaders) with permissions (used by leader threshold consensus) to remove a role and restrict an address from a role.

The funds are not reflecting in my coinbase account which is the address that it is sitting in currently. Coin base is stating that the address is and was never a coinbase ETH address for any of my accounts under my email or usernames. Which is bogus because in the recent crypto addresses under ETH that exact address was generated from my prior coinbase acct. with the time frame exactly the same as the address i used for the tx to receive. OR AM I REALLY A NOOB and missing something!? coinbase just keeps saying ""my money is gone since its not sent to my exact ETH address in any of my accounts"". but they are the same address just in different order like coinbase stated ""making different address every transaction but they still be the same alpha and numeric"". which this address in the tx is the same Alpha and Numeric.

Though if you just want to use metamask, for privacy reasons or else. You can ""couple"" it with coingecko, and create a portfolio to keep a track of your eth price, it's pretty precise.

If you want to stake on metamask, I would recommend taking some serious security protection. As it's just secured by a password by default. If you really want to stake on metamask, really activate as much security as you can. Like 2fa, and such. For that crypto.com is amazing, because you have : Password, then passcode, then 2fa. So it's really good. 

Although you need to be 18 or use the identity of an adult like me. Crypto.com also offers a free Debit card, that you can use with 0%fee so that's also a a great feature.

I just want to let you know that before coming here, I searched almost everywhere for a solution. I just didn't jump in here like that. 
Actually I did a transfert of ETH from my Metamask via BSC mainnet. I entered the destination address and it seems that I entered a wrong address since the ETH sent never arrived where I wanted it to arrive. I then checked bscscan and I found that the destination address I entered was 0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8 which is the Binance-Peg Ethereum Token. Don't ask me how I did that, I don't know.

My question is, is it possible de retrieve my ETH?

I don't know if this is the right place for my question, if not, could you please redirect me?

Thank you for any help","",""

So, I have a little amount of ETH and ERC20 assets on Layer1. If I want to move ERC20 assets I have to pay gas (ETH). This part is clear to me.

Let's say, I want to convert (swap) ETH or ERC20 to stable coins. Which options do I have? -> Exchanges.

I had a 4TB hard-drive and everything seemed to be going fine, but it was taking forever to download the entire thing.  I knew it might take days, but it was like, literally two weeks and wasn't even near the total size of what I read the Ethereum blockchain was; at the time it was two terabytes or something.  Isn't there a way to download a huge chunk of the blockchain that's already carved in stone, so to speak, then start the smaller version of a node.  I downloaded Geth and finally figured out how to run the node on my computer, but save the actual blockchain on the external SSD 4TB hard drive.  Never reached the end, just kept downloading and checking.  Any suggestions?","",""

But you can go to wallet. polygon. technology(Its where your polygon funds are actually kept) login to the wallet and on the left there's an option to ""swap token for gas"" there you can change some WETH to MATIC, 1-2 MATIC will do hundreds of transactions. Buying NFTs on Ethereum is tricky b/c of high gas fees, you pay gas to do a transaction, and if it's a complicated transaction like a smart contract, the fees are almost double. You can go to etherscan gas tracker to see realtime gas fees for transfers and ERC-721 transfers etc. Side note, people often ask for your public wallet address to look it up on etherscan b/c it shows transaction history and tells you why transactions failed (ie not enough gas) if you aren't comfortable giving it out thats perfectly fine, you can go to etherscan yourself, punch in your wallet address and view all the info. Each network has its owner blockchain scanner, the polygon one is polygonscan, same story there. Hope this helps!","",""

ETH buys almost everything on the ethereum network, and covers gas fees, you usually don't need WETH on the ethereum network. WETH comes into play on a sidechain like the polygon network(2nd largest network on opensea) when your ETH moves to polygon it becomes ""Wrapped ETH"" .... unfortunately rushing into crypto is not recommended as its very easy to make mistakes that are not reversible(like paying gas fees to cancel a transaction) If you are using metamask you will need to manually add the polygon network under custom networks, and manually add the relevant tokens you wish to hold(ie WETH) edit: its also not recommended to play with the gas fee adjustments in metamask, if you set them too low it can stall the transaction and just cost you gas üò¨","",""

NFTs can be priced in whatever currency the NFT market allows(ETH, WETH, MATIC, USDC etc) but you always need the native token of a Blockchain to pay gas fees (Ethereum=eth, polygon=matic, Solana=Sol, etc) NFTs are fun but can be a bit of a waste of money if you aren't careful, first generation NFTs were basically cool pictures, 2nd generation NFTs have more functionality (like doubling as an access pass to a club/game/marketplace)","",""

After my first post here I really appreciate your engagements with me so thank you 
But I still don't made any progress on my situation
I just claim a reward from a team member if Cron Token Friday of 0.194 btc and it's still exist on my Cron Token trading platform account.
The requirement is that I need to deposit a minimum of to have the status of USER:
 0.01 BTC
 0.144754 ETH
3.330391 LTC
1.297315 BCH 

Then I will be able to make a Widhtraw
and transfer it to another platform called Paxful that I prefer for our area here in Morocco

What I need is your help some give me this deposit required and when I will make the withdraw I will immediately resend it with bonus 

I know that is a lot of scam and mistrust but I'm really real I don't lie 
I just want to exploit this reward because it will expire today after 48 hours","","ü§£ (2)"

What is NFT, exactly? A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind data that allows digital content like photos, movies, and songs to be authenticated on cryptocurrencies like blockchains, primarily ethereum. The primary advantage of NFTs is that they make owning and selling digital content straightforward.


On our website, we sell NFT arts, and if you buy one, you'll become a member of our SHIFTERSAPE. We'll be listing it out soon. 10,000 NFTs were manufactured, according to our team's statistics, but only 1,000 would be listed in the initial batch. A fraction of the remaining NFTs will be burnt before it is listed.

You'll be making more than 200% from our NFT once it's released.

We're building an authentication layer solution for NFTs that places digital signatures right within the content of the NFTs and in order to demonstrate our technology, how it works, and it's impact, we started building an NFT marketplace to incorporate this solution. We are preparing for a mainnet launch soon but until then we would like to start onboarding users on our beta testnets version.

The problem we're currently facing is that we're bringing in artists who are unfamiliar with the blockchain, and it's difficult to explain to them how to obtain test ethers in order to mint their NFTs. 

The question I have is whether it is possible to obtain a big chunk of test ETH for the Rinkeby network. I am aware that there are a few Faucets available, but none of them work properly except for the Chainlink faucet, which is not particularly intuitive and only provides 0.1 ETH. 

Thank you!","",""

I just joined this server, and I guess this is the right channel for this type of discussion: 
I was scrolling through this document json-rpc (https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API) and function eth_sendTransaction is what I wanted to test locally (I am running private nodes of ropsten/rinkeby testnet), I was able to send tETH from one address to another and the payload looks like this:
params: [from:""sender's account address"", to:""receiver's account address"", value: ""some amount in wei""] also tested with other optional params i.e. gas_price etc.
This works as expected and in response to the curl request I get tx_hash also the receiver receives its desired funds too.

But now I wanted to test the same with ERC-20 tokens as on paper you can any ERC-20 token to any ETH account address.

I have been searching for a while now, and this is what I have attempted till now:

-> Firstly, I need to get some ERC-20 tokens, which I obtained by swapping tETH to USDT using Uniswap & Coinbase wallet (Rinkeby Testnet) [I was unable to convert/swap my tETH to ERC-20 tokens on Ropsten therefore, I moved to rinkeby network].
-> After digging deeper into this method ""eth_sendTransaction"" and searching on the web. I have assumed, to send tokens to some address I need to populate the ""data"" field in params: [] with compiled code of some smart contract's transfer function. (If yes, then how?).
-> I assumed this after looking into the swap transaction I performed on Uniswap (on etherscan). I have noticed:
from: contains my provided address,
to: contains Uniswap's smart contract address
[and a transfer is performed from smart contract address to my address i.e. TRANSFER  xyz Ether From ""contract address"" To ""destination address""]

So long story short, hope I am able to tell what I am trying to do, all I need is the direction or an answer to my question. If I am doing something wrong please point it out.
Any help would be much appreciated ü•∞ .","","‚ù§Ô∏è (4)"

I have a vast history of working on several projects where my skill sets were required. I have built different AI and ML projects from bots for websites to gravity simulation. I have created Solana SPL tokens and remodeled dApps. I can share links for more details if you‚Äôre interested. 

I will create secure smart contracts that work seamlessly with UI/UX that will keep your users glued to their screen while using your dApp. 

I hope to speak to you soon to learn more about how I can help you grow your business.

To my understanding when mainnet switches over to PoS it will become more efficient to generate more blocks, so it may decrease gas prices slightly.

Because I didn't need it immediatelly, I lowered the GWEI and Priority Fee and Gas Limit in Metamask before hitting the ‚Äûsend‚Äú Button. Because the Fees are changing significantly in one day (it seems to be low in special timeframes every day), I thought I could lower the Fee so that it's executed when the Fee price drops (for example in 7-12hours). I thought if the fee is too low, my transaction will be stuck till the fees drop and than it's going to be executed. But it failed. So I paid the fee but nothing is transfered. Why has it failed and not being stuck? Shouldn't it be stucked? Do you know what makes the difference for a transaction getting stuck and a transaction to fail? It was not a swap on a dex, it was a transfer of ERC20 Tokens from one address to the other.","",""

I was doing some calculations about rewards that validators will get after the merge to PoS, and I got a little confused about how te current gas system will work after The Merge. 

Today, the gas fee is burned and the tip is paid to the miners, obviously. But after the PoS, when stakers' rewards will be decided using those pre-determined formulas that respect balance staked and so, how will tips be a part of stakers' rewards? With today's network, I calculate that you currently have about 0.2 ETH to be paid out in total per block (total attesters + proposer), so will tips be a part of those 0.2 ETH? What will happen if overall tips amount to more than those 0.2 ETH designed to be payed per block?

Appreciate anyone who could give me some insights on that matter!

Thank you very much!","",""

I have one remark as well‚Ä¶ the language is very important, but ‚Ä¶. This blockchain technology (and what is related to it) need special knowledge not just in language. As the market is growing day by day with users, followers etc., I think most of peoples, who are involved in it, don‚Äôt understand what they are doing. They invest in the hope of the future profit. Somewhere is a game (hobby), but it‚Äôs investment. I think the Ethereum open a massive window with the word of the Nft-s as well. The Nft‚Äôs are more and more interesting for the younger generation.  In my environment, I saw more and more teens, who want to collect, create, buy, sell nft‚Äôs.

I learn it recently this way:

1- Looking at the OpenZeppelin contract preset as example for ERC721/ERC20 tokens.

2- read docs about the solidity language specificities (keywords like external/internal, modifiers, unchecked, use ... for ..., ...) for each things you don't understand exactly.

3- Read some EIP/ERC, like the ERC165, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, ERC2981, ... from the Ethereum website, because this allow you to understand more exactly how the token/NFT really works on the blockchain.

4- learn about the security best practices/attacks/known hacks (from ""Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices"", ...), and experiment on local blockchain and/or testnets before doing anything on the mainnet. (and don't trust contracts you call dynamically from your own contract).

5- Look at some verified smartcontract on etherscan/... To see some real usage of solidity. Also you must keep in mind that some implementation (not truly obvious) lead to unexpected behavior (like the OpenSea lazy-minting of ERC1155 and it's conditional response of the balanceOf calls that can lead to failed transferFrom through operators contract if creator never triggered the ""true"" mint of the required amount from the NFT supply...)

6- Read the changelogs/history of solidity versions, because unlike JavaScript, Solidity have breaking-change that could need some reworks of your code if you want to compile it with the latest stable version of solc.","",""

the issue I am having with my devs is that we can't find anything to help us show the country locations of the nodes like it shows on Etherscan and on Ethernodes.org. When I reached out to Etherscan they said they dont reveal that info in their API and it is only internal. 

The issue is, is that showing where majority of the nodes are is part of what makes a node map and shows transparency in the network. 

Can anyone help me with this? aka figuring out how to show country locations of the nodes in the network. Would greatly appreciate it. 

here is an example: https://etherscan.io/nodetracker

- next it downloads from the network whole blockchain: every transaction (balance changes) and smart contract's data
- using this information it can build current network state, by starting at the begining.

To cancel a transaction you basically need to create a new transaction from your account with the same nonce as the stuck transaction, but for 0 ETH - you will need enough ether in your wallet to pay the gas for the new transaction to get picked up though, so you might choose to fund you rwallet with more ether and speed it up instead.","",""

Ethereum is the most popular smart-contract chain and thus the blockspace is in high demand. The higher the demand the higher the gas. Other chains don't have anywhere near the activity of Ethereum and if they did, they would likely see various problems such as congestion, down-time and fee issues. 
Don't be alarmed though as there are solutions in place that are growing in functionality and adoption. 
Are either of you familiar with Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum (https://portal.arbitrum.one) ? 
Arbitrum is a Layer 2 Optimistic rollup. It sits on top of the base layer and inherits its security, though with much higher throughput. As a rollup it bundles transactions together before finalizing them and writing them back to the base-layer. Therefore the more transactions batched together, the cheaper the fees.

"215775491922198530","JBudz#1337","13-Apr-22 11:52 AM","Proof of Stake is a much higher security model. It doesn't cost a lot to buy hardware and attack POW networks. You simply need to have more hash-rate than 51% of the network resources and a lot of energy. You can then perpetually attack the network and even spawn-camp it indefinitely (when the chain forks, you attack the new chain).  If a Proof of Stake validator acts maliciously and tries to falsify the network or attack it, its balance gets slashed thus an increased cost to continue the attack. 

As for the ""bloated congested blockchain"" comment, if any other smart-contract chain had the demand that Ethereum had, they would run into similar issues. For instance Solana has had multiple shutdowns due to network congestion due to the high centralization and low fees. 

The great thing about Layer 2 and their adoption is bridges. It's now possible to directly interact with Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum without ever having to interact with the main-chain. For instance, you can now bridge from Binance directly to Arbitrum.  You can even use the RenBridge to bridge BTC directly to Arbitrum, convert it to wBTC and then loan it out in DeFi solutions such as Impermax or AAVE. Pretty cool.","",""

**Ethereum was premined. Ethereum is controlled by Vitalik. (u/aaqy, u/ec265)**
I'm not a fan of ICOs, and Ethereum certainly did have one. I don't like ninja mining either, like Bitcoin. We have seen some DeFi projects have fair launches with airdrops to users, and this is certainly the best way to distribute tokens.

However, It's important to understand the context - back in 2014 this was simply the fairest way to raise funding. At genesis, Ethereum Foundation held ~12M ETH. However, over the years, this has been distributed - a lot of it seems to be fundraising in the early years. Currently Ethereum Foundation and early developers hold ~2% of the supply at most. Vitalik owns 0.3% of all ETH.

Contrast this with other projects where the founders often hold 20% or more, public corporations like Tesla or Amazon with a similar amount, or Satoshi holding 5% of all BTC. (Was as high as 50+% in 2009/10, and yes, they are assumed lost and not comparable anyway.) I would even go ahead and say that 0.3% is absolutely not enough to adequately incentivize a founder to keep working on the project!

Would I have preferred to see Ethereum do a fairer launch? Sure. But today, in the here and now, Ethereum has the fairest distribution among founders of any project.

Greetings !

I need help from the team to resolve the below matter.
Would really really appreciate if the same can be addressed.

I had swapped Cotrader to Ethereum in my trust wallet using Uniswap around 10 days ago.
The transaction shows successful but Ethereum is not yet transfered to my Trust wallet. I had sent an email to Trust wallet also. Forwarding the same email to you below.

I double checked everything before doing so I am sure there has to be technical glitch which I am sure you guys will resolve and get me funds in my Ethereum wallet.

Also, please find attached all my transaction details.

Your help and support in this matter is greatly appreciated.","",""

As for execution speed and transaction fees, rollups solve this.

Smart Contract in of itself isn't a big deal as most Smart Contracts consist of more or less 400 lines of code. It's the overall application working flow that makes it a thing.

Third, proposer boosting means blocks released earlier in a slot have greater weight in the fork choice rule, creating an asymmetry between the competing blocks from the perspective of the fork choice algorithm.

I have a very basic question about eth supply. I know how it decreases (some gas is burnt) but how does it increase?

Can anyone point me to an article/video about this?","",""
"690684791259004989","Corwintines#2877","10-May-22 12:10 AM","So there is a basefee burn mechanism that was introduced with EIP-1559 in the London upgrade. This fee will be burnt every transaction. ETH issuance is still the same, but is now offset by this burning of fees. So if the network is particularly active (often with NFT drops), you will often see more ETH being burned than being issued, causing ETH to be deflationary. On the other end, if the network isnt super active, more ETH will be issued than burned and the supply increases. 

The EIP: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559

Miners have large expenses (electricity, hardware, rent, cooling) so often sell a lot of their mined ETH to the market. Without this sell pressure from the miners, less ETH is added to the available supply to buy, therefore ETH becomes rarer. 

Also, instead of rewards going to miners it goes to stakers. Therefore more incentive for people to buy ETH and stake. 

In addition, to secure the network staked ETH will be be locked for 6 months~ after the merge. Less sell pressure.

More DEFI adoption = more locked ETH = less circulating supply = ETH becomes scarce and more valuable. 

Add EIP1559 (the burning mechanism) with more usage = more burning = less supply.","",""

Greetings !

I need help from the team to resolve the below matter.
Would really really appreciate if the same can be addressed.

I had swapped Cotrader to Ethereum in my trust wallet using Uniswap around 45 days ago.
The transaction shows successful but Ethereum is not yet transfered to my Trust wallet. I had sent an email to Trust wallet also. Forwarding the same email to you below.

I double checked everything before doing so I am sure there has to be technical glitch which I am sure you guys will resolve and get me funds in my Ethereum wallet.


Your help and support in this matter is greatly appreciated.","",""

From my knowledge, PoS has a problem that data, which controls security of the system, exists within the system itself. So there is a simulation argument - one might simulate PoS system from the start and you will not know which is real and which is fake. With PoW the one with more work is probably the real one - i.e. simulation is very expensive. Thus PoS needs to rely on ""weak subjectivity"" - you need some point of reference when you join a system, i.e. you need not just code, but also data on some recent blocks, e.g. few months or years ago. It's very hard to make PoS right. PoS often needs to rely on randomness, and that randomness needs to come from within the system, which is very tricky. From what I know.

I will only invest in Ethereum because the architecture lends itself for full-fledged, commercial integration and product development. Right now I‚Äôm looking at Crypto‚Äôs role in the post-convergence phase of integration. Evaluating Dapps, singling out developers and ideas that should prove valuable to mainstream investors of future tech. Eth is, in my opinion, the best bet for universal success. Financial products are already rolling off. Since I‚Äôm a Big Block enthusiast, I envision Super-Ledgers,  Private Super-Nodes, Private Verification Nodes and Private Green Mining. It‚Äôs all going to look great for Ethereum pros. Build your hearts out!
The best ideas may swim to the top, get noticed, and before you know it, Private industry is using your product and you are getting rich off of creator licensing fees for use of the dApp.
So many ways for Eth enthusiasts to make money as a pro, build great things and interact with existing Global financial markets.
I make Art NFTs now. The future of NFT media is secure, on-block media that can‚Äôt be copied or counterfeit. The pieces are there now but I can‚Äôt develop it all myself.

But if the coin is decentralized, no one should be able to change the entire structure of the coin just like that, right?
So how will the entire process of switching to proof of stake go around? Will they need everyone on the network to agree to start using proof of stake, or how does it work?","",""

I have a little question concerning reading blockchain. I hope you won't mind that I ask here, I believe someone might have the answer or a tip üôÇ

Given a list of transactions made with a wallet, I'd like to identify the ones made from / to a major exchange platform (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc...). Any idea of a library, or public record that would allow me to identify these addresses ? 
I can't find this kind of information with Web3.js, Ethers.js, Alchemy, Infura... Didn't find anything on Google either. My guess is that big companies have their own registry ? Etherscan would have their own as well.

My goal with this is to identify which transactions are related to a deposit / withdraw of Eth.","",""

I‚Äôm researching user scams (crypto) and would be interested in speaking to anyone you know that may have suffered / been deceived by a scam. 

Do you know someone that would be willing to talk to me about their experiences (Just a brief 10-15min chat)? 

Feel free to message me on discord or my TG is @Snapcrackle). 

 I cannot help anyone recover funds or look into the specifics however it will be helping us learn a lot about how the scams operate which could save someone else in the future.","","üëç (1),‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

Thank you for the reply and apologies for the delay to your ticket!

Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds as per our terms of service agreement: https://www.enjin.com/terms#refund-policy
As of now, we have no plans for the Enjin CMS to shut down.
I apologise for any inconvenience or trouble caused.

Let me know if you have any questions or problems at all, and I will assist you further. :)

```The issue here is that he transferred ENJ through Kucoin Blockchain (which is not supported by the Enjin Wallet), advised him to gather his 12 words recovery phrase and reimport it over to a wallet that supports Kucoin Blockchain tokens.```

You will not see your ENJ in the Enjin Wallet because you transferred it on Kucoin Blockchain, not Ethereum Blockchain. You will need to import your wallet in another wallet app that support Kukoin Blockchain in order to see the ENJ. Additionally, please check your junk mail for emails from Enjin, it's quite possible you missed them because they went to your junk folder.

As you can see, the transaction you're referring to does not exist on etherscan, thus did not take place on the Ethereum blockchain: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb9ec95c1c3b0fce7e2b0b56e3ee9b9ec2f13c18b3f7efddf7b24376f08eeca96

Answer all questions and make folks feel like you care about them and address their concerns.  They will in turn spread the word about the project and recruit other supporters

The worst way to engage is to have a Discord channel and not to answer any questions from visitors.  Team Enjin may or may not realize this, but Discord has become the defacto place in the cryptoverse for new users to learn about a project.  The interactions, while can be time consuming, is far more useful than any Medium or webpage postings.  And definitely more useful than a Telegram channel that doesnt organize info for consumption.  When users dont get any responses, it will brew mistrust and cause them to question the team's competency since thats not the norm for crypto projects.  Rather than evangelizing about the project, they will badmouth the project to their friends.  

For a team that needs to garner user support in order to win a parachain slot, Enjin is doing the exact opposite of what it should do.  With no bonuses/time based incentives or a responsive Discord channel, it will fail miserably here.

Even if it does not plan to win a slot in this batch and aims for the next batch, having an unresponsive Discord only serves to allow negative perceptions to proliferate such that when Enjin is ready to fight for a slot, it will first have to overcome this FUD

Really hope Enjin course corrects soon.  Yes, I am looking at you @EtayM @Hoppertrophy @alenn @FlintBleopard And pls dont tell me to email support since they dont respond","",""

Is there any chance we could have another vote on whether or not to make MFT's tradeable?

The vote from years ago was very nearly 50/50, and from the 2 other MFT owners that I know they agree that trading MFT's should be allowed, I myself agree of course. Mind you, of the 3 of us who own MFT's only 1 person is even remotely interested in potentially selling the MFT, we just believe that locking it seems fairly arbitrary, and we believe that anyone who is a hardcore Enjin supporter should be able to own one.

I have a feeling that many of the MFT holders would feel the same as we do, and I think the vote today would give quite different results than the 50% on each side that it was a couple of years back.","",""

The fifth slot is within Enjin's reach, but Manta and Clover are ahead and presumably also aiming for that slot as well.  If Enjin does not win during the first batch, will it go again during the 2nd batch?  At which point Centrifuge, Equilibrium, and others will be going for slots as well.  Any insights that you can provide as to Enjin's auction strategy is appreciated as that will allow me to plan for my contributions.

I have a question.

If you access: https://parachains.info/auctions and you check for the timeline chart, you will see that there is a point in the chart ""Efinity Won"". This point shows earlier thant the actual ""auction end"" mark on 30th. But i'm almost 100% that this point is new in this graph and only appeared after December 30.

If you pass mouse over this point, you will see: ""Efinity is the winner of Auction#6 The candle ""blew out"" at Dec 25, 21:19:36. This is a randomly selected block after the auction ends. Efinity: 6,004,920 DOT Composable Finance: 3,777,755 DOT""

Can anyone explains what this means? If you contribute to crowdloan after December 25, 21:19:36h, this means you will not be rewarded?

Thanks","",""

In theory, it sounds like other titles can choose to mint their NFTs on the enjin platform? Doing so injects enjin coin into the NFTs to give them some base of value that you can melt them down for?

My ask is, couldn't those titles just mint hundreds of thousands or millions of nfts thus flooding the market of potential enjin coin? Are there controls for how many can be minted?

I am a full-stack developer focused on blockchain development on Ethereum, Binance, and Solana. I have a lot of hands-on experience with the Defi platform and NFT Marketplace development. Also, I have good knowledge of Metaverse as well. I am familiar with smart contracts, wallets connection, NFT collection, and NFT marketplace frontend & backend. My strongest skill sets are Solidity, Rust, web3.js, react.js, vue.js, python, golang, Unity, Unreal Engine, and DevOps. 

At the moment, I am looking for a blockchain full stack development role, and I am wondering if you have any position regarding my skill sets.
If so, I would like to discuss more details with you.

Best wish,

The powered by Enjin games would likely need you to link up your wallet to their project. The linking process essentially connects your wallet to receive NFTs etc (depending on the game). It's not like MetaMask, as the Enjin Wallet only supports ERC-1155 NFTs and doesn't support all NFTs in question.

Therefore, we are searching for a protocol that could make use of all we have created in the past 2 years.



In the spirit of boundless creativity, could you please forward this mail/document to whoever might be searching for such content?



All I have to offer is listed in the PDF. (Click on ""what we offer"" on the main website)

It serves as an example of what the early concept of the game could look like, but being open-minded, someone could use the content in a completely different way.

For example, Nft card game developers looking for high-quality art. 



What kind of project is this? 

A carefully thought out NFT-RPG set in dark fantasy, inspired by games like Witcher, Skyrim, Spellforce & by animes like Berserk, Claymore, and Attack on Titan! Also, Warhammer fantasy/4k :)



You can take a quick look at the official website for a general idea.

https://www.ariaofblight.com/





If there is any more information we can provide please let us know!





Thank you for your help!!!
